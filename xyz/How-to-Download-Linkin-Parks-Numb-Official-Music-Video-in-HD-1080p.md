Linkin Park's Numb is one of the most successful songs of the 2000s. It was the third and final single from their second studio album, Meteora, released in 2003. The song peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock charts. It also reached the top 10 in several other countries, such as Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand.
 
The song was written by the band's lead vocalist Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda, who also produced it with Don Gilmore. The song is about feeling alienated and misunderstood by others, especially by one's parents. Bennington said that the song was inspired by his own experiences of being abused as a child and feeling numb to the pain. Shinoda said that the song was also influenced by his own struggles with fitting in as a Japanese-American.
 
The official music video for Numb was directed by Joe Hahn, the band's DJ and visual artist. The video features the band performing in a Gothic church in Prague, Czech Republic, while a young girl (played by Briana Evigan) faces various problems at school and home. She is shown to be an outcast who is bullied by her classmates and ignored by her mother. She also has a passion for art, but her mother disapproves of it. The video ends with the girl running away from her home and joining the band in the church.

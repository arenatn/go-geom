## What is Von?
 
Von (which means "Hope" in Icelandic) is the first studio album by Sigur Ros. It was recorded over two years and underwent several changes before being released. The band was not satisfied with the final result and considered scrapping it, but decided to release it anyway. [^2^]
 
Von consists of 12 tracks that range from 18 seconds to 13 minutes in length. The album showcases the band's experimental and avant-garde approach to music, using unconventional instruments, vocals, and effects. The album also features some samples from nature, such as birds, water, and wind. [^2^]
 
The album received positive reviews from critics in Iceland, but went largely unnoticed abroad until the band's later albums gained international recognition. In 2004, Von was re-released in the UK and the US, and in 2005 it was certified platinum in Iceland. [^2^]
 
Some of the highlights of Von are:
 
- Sigur Ros: The opening track and the band's namesake. It is a nine-minute instrumental piece that sets the tone for the album with its haunting and hypnotic melody.
- Hafssol: The longest track on the album at 12 minutes. It is a dynamic and epic song that builds up from a quiet intro to a loud and distorted climax.
- Von: The title track and one of the few songs with vocals on the album. It is a beautiful and melancholic ballad that showcases Jonsi's falsetto voice.
